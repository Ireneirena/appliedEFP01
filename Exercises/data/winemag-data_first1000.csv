0,US,"This is quite soft and pretty, a charming wine with appealing flavors of rose water, cherry and sandalwood. Not for keeping, but most enjoyable right now.",Vineyard Select,87,18.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Gresser
1,France,"A crisp, fresh Riesling that manages to be lean without being mean, cushioning its racy acids with just enough lime and green apple fruit flavors.",Le Dragon,86,34.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Josmeyer
2,US,"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish.",Grand Cru,85,15.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Raphael
3,Argentina,"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.",Reserva,90,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
4,Italy,"Aromas of wild flower, honey and peach characterize this fresh, vintage-dated Extra Dry Prosecco. There's a touch of sweetness on the finish backed by spicy effervescence.",Villa Luigia Millesimato Extra Dry,87,20.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Il Follo
5,US,"Nice aromas suggest cassis and deep, wild mountain berry; the wine has a suppleness long missing from the Hogue lineup. Tannins are still quite evident, and in this young wine come across as just a bit green and scrapey. But with more bottle age, decanting, or maybe just a good greasy steak they will mellow and be entirely welcome.",Genesis,86,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hogue
6,US,"A worthy followup to the 2001, it's not as voluptuous, but is better structured and is likely more ageworthy. The wine is tannic, but balanced and rich in Cabernet fruit. It has that edge of elegant complexity that marks a great wine. Drink now–2015.",Reserve,93,60.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
7,US,"Distinctly different from the Avery vineyard bottling, this has pleasing, brambly strawberry fruit flavors, intertwined with spice, cola and a bit of Dr. Pepper. Not a big wine, but loaded with fruit flavor.",Les Collines Vineyard,88,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Zinfandel,Three Angels
8,US,"This gets the award for the most confusing label of the month. It says Vigil “Tradicion” and also names the vineyard, then writes Mokelumne River Old Vines, and finishes with Lodi. Talk about information overload! Bottom line: it's a fruity, oaky, simple and straightforward bottle of Zin. 'Nuff said.",Marissa Vineyard,85,16.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Vigil
9,US,"Unique in style and sourced—these are the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country—this young, yeasty, textural wine will surely continue to improve in the bottle. Give it a lot of breathing time, and complex layers of rock and fruit unfold. Jicama, cucumber, daikon radish...You get the idea. It tastes as clean and fresh as a mountain spring.",Original Vines,92,22.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,The Eyrie Vineyards
10,US,"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential.",,91,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
11,Portugal,"This is a seemingly weet rosé, with a good balance between its strawberry fruit and acidity. The wine is slightly sparkling and crisp, making it a delicious apéritif. Screwcap.",,85,,Vinho Verde,,,Rosé,Vera
12,US,"Light in body, with a tobaccoey, dried herb quality to the cherry fruit. Finishes fast, but quite an elegant wine, and should age for a while.",,87,55.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
13,Italy,"Nicely linear and compact, this wine has many elements that make it particularly food friendly. The bouquet is characterized by aromas of black fruit, tobacco, Indian tea and spice. The mouthfeel is tonic, tight and crisp.",Litina,89,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Cascina Castlet
14,US,"This shows the two classic markers of this vineyard: brisk, mouthwatering acidity and superripe flavors. The orange and peach notes meld with an apricot tone, which may have a touch of botrytis, lending a hint of honey. For all the richness, it's bone dry and minerally. Lovely now, but these Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnays age interestingly, gradually losing fruit and gaining nut and earthy notes.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,89,33.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Joullian
15,France,"From the same stable as Clos Nardian and Le Dôme, this is a well-balanced wine, with grassy fresh flavors, and some good green fruit. The citrus element gives a great lift to the wine, leaving a delicious finish.",Contre le Vent,88,27.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Teyssier
16,Turkey,"Aromas of black cherry and green pepper lead into flavors of cherry, menthol, pickled jalapeño, oregano and lavender. Tannins mildly outweigh acidity. Although all the pieces of the puzzle are evident on the palate, somehow they don't fit together perfectly.",Kirte Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah-Petit Verdot,87,17.0,Thrace,,,Red Blend,Suvla
17,France,"With 25% new wood, this has good roundness, but it has kept a deliciously fresh mineral character. The aftertaste is all almonds, ripeness and vivid fruit flavors.",,86,36.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,,Chardonnay,Henri de Villamont
18,US,"Shut down by hard tannins and utterly dry, this fine young Cabernet is simply not ready to drink. It's very rich in blackberries, smoked meat and charred wood, with a finish that's fine, long and sweet in ripe fruits. Should blossom after 2014 and hold for a number of years.",,92,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
19,US,"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years.",Reserve,93,100.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Von Strasser
20,Australia,"This is, perhaps, one of the strangest wines I have ever tasted. The aromas are of the sea—brine and seaweed—over a smidge of blackberry fruit. Ditto the palate. Medium-bodied, not too tannic, and ends with a black peppery note that evens out once the wine sits for a few minutes. Bizarre.",,82,19.0,South Australia,Riverland,,Petit Verdot,Ellen Landing
21,Italy,"This gorgeous Pinot Grigio displays the fresh aromatic fragrances associated with cool-climate, mountain winemaking. Layers of jasmine, tangerine, cut grass and white almond appear on the bouquet, giving this wine a delicate and feminine personality. A spicy touch of acidity drives the clean, bright finish.",,90,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Grigio,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro
22,Portugal,"From 100% Azal grapes, this is a rich style of Vinho Verde, ripe and citric, touched by minerality. Yeasty aromas go through the palate but don't detract from the ripe final fruit.",Azal,87,12.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Solar de Pinheiro
23,US,"Much in the style of the outstanding 2008, this elegant, Burgundian-like Pinot Noir is a finessed wine, with lovely details of rose petal and penetrating raspberry fruit. There's a pleasing transparency, keeping it light without losing focus or depth, and the finely rendered tannins put the perfect period at the end of the sentence.",Lachini Family Estate,91,45.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Lachini
24,France,88–90. Barrel sample. Hedgerow aromas and herbal flavors open a wine that is lightly fruity and soft in texture. There is only the lightest touch of botrytis evident.,Barrel Sample,89,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Doisy-Daëne
25,Italy,"Gianni Brunelli's elegant Brunello opens with a bright ruby color and a lean, tonic appearance. Yet the aromas of cherry, anise seed and wild flowers are intense and beautiful. The mouthfeel is streamlined and compact.",,88,75.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Gianni Brunelli
26,Australia,"Although this wine is clearly darker and more intensely concentrated than its little sibling, with more capacity for aging, it's also more stern and less pretty. Blueberry and plum fruit is set off by savory spice and meat notes, with firm tannins and the potential to evolve through 2015 or beyond.",Lieu dit Malakoff,90,40.0,Victoria,Pyrenees,,Shiraz,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier
27,Chile,"Slightly pickled on the nose and palate, with little acidity and kick. Flavors of apple, white raisin and cabbage carry a vanilla accent, and the finish is full, melony, sweet and soft. Generic, without much vitality.",Reserva,83,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,MontGras
28,US,"Creamy and lightly toasty, this elegant Chardonnay mixes its melon/apple fruit with vanilla cream and toasted cracker. The acid feels natural and brings in suggestions of pineapple, with a nice smack of butter kicking out the finish.",Estate,88,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Ryan Patrick
29,Italy,"The evident oak element in this hearty Brunello needs time to integrate because the spice, toasted nut, clove and crushed peppercorn aromas are still strong. But the mouthfeel is soft, plush and shows great potential.",Franci,90,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tassi
30,Italy,"This 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows a bright cherry aroma, with spice, leather and tar notes in the background. It shows a soft, plush feel, with good balance.",,91,35.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Superiore,,Red Blend,Ferrari Iris e Figli
31,South Africa,"Sweet and floral with assertive aromas of crushed violets, dark berries and a touch of milk chocolate. Easy in the mouth with a medium weight, round texture and soft tannins. The finish is loaded with juicy black fruit flavors. Drink now.",,86,18.0,Cederberg,,,Merlot-Shiraz,Cederberg
32,Italy,"Aromas include white spring flowers, tropical fruit and a hint of graphite. The juicy palate offers green apples, white peach and melon alongside fresh acidity. Delicate almond marks the close.",Montunal,87,15.0,Lombardy,Lugana,,Turbiana,Montonale
33,US,"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",Switchback Red,89,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,Coeur d'Alene
34,France,"There aren't many aristocratic estates in the largely peasant-based culture of Pouilly. But this is one, and it's old, dating back to 1396. The Estutt d'Assay family makes one wine, an estate wine: This 2004 has great elegance, not hugely rich, but with fine, pure fruit flavors that are already well balanced. There's roundness from the terroir of Tract-sur-Loire as well as a streak of fine acidity. Imported by Louis Latour Inc.",,91,35.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Château de Tracy
35,US,"A lightweight Pinot that's actually marketed as a rosé, this wine nevertheless manages to pack in decent flavors of apple skin, red berries and cinnamon, capped off by some leathery, meaty notes.",Fleurette,83,10.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Rosé,Hargrave

39,France,"A dense wine, the wood just showing at this stage through its dark tannins and superb rich fruit. The wine is ripe, with a density of tannins that go right down deep. Big and powerful.",,94,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos du Marquis
40,Chile,"Earthy and smells a bit of compost along with dry leaves, grilled meat and herbal fruit. The palate is edgy, with snappy acidity propelling lean raspberry and cherry flavors. Peppery and light on the quick finish.",Reserva,84,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Portal Del Alto

42,South Africa,A nose of hay and sweet perfume opens to overripe and slightly oxidized flavors. Just too soft and too sweet.,Reserve,80,15.0,Robertson,,,Chardonnay,Van Loveren
43,France,"A youthful, pale straw color is the backdrop of haunting aromas of Marcona almond, dried lemon peel and hay. Zesty citrus notes on the palate are accompanied by hazelnut, baguette crust and vanilla. The vanilla continues on with the medium finish—a clear indicator of some oak influence. Round and succulent, yet balanced by fairly refreshing acidity.",Exquises Esquisses,88,,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières,,Grenache Blanc,Château Maylandie
44,Italy,"Succulent Sangiovese makes up half the blend and austere Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc are the other half, giving the wine a fine balance between power and elegance. You'll notice cherry, sage, coffee and candle incense over firm tannins.",San Leopoldo,88,45.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Il Poggione
45,US,"Once again the Jerome Reserve delivers the goods—a fine core of ripe cherry fruit, wrapped in pretty new oak. It's full-bodied, round and textural, while retaining a crisp, well-defined focus.

46,France,"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years.",Le Clos Blanc Grèves Premier Cru,92,75.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Chardonnay,Louis Jadot
47,France,"This powerful, concentrated effort shows dense tannins that are balanced by rich black fruits. The wine has a sense of elegance that balances all of the richness. It's worth aging for at least 4 years.",,90,,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Supérieur,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Argadens
48,France,"88—90 Barrel sample. The second wine of Valandraud, a wine that goes more for tannins than its big brother. The fruit is less obvious, less attractive.",Barrel sample,89,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos Badon
49,Italy,"The name Grignolino comes from the dialect word for “seeds.” The grape, on the other hand, requires special winemaking techniques in order to soften the wine's tannins due to the natural abundance of seeds. Light in color and bright with fresh fruit characteristics, this would make an ideal red aperitivo wine.",,85,17.0,Piedmont,Monferrato,,Grignolino,Quattro Leoni
50,US,"A fine vintage of Bill Easton's Cabernet Franc, from the Monarch Mine Vineyard, where he typically sources tremendous Syrah and Barbera, this wine is still developing and will do nicely with time. For now it shows perfumed herbal restraint, subtle spice and a twist of oaky coffee on the finish.

54,Spain,"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",Rosé,82,7.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Borsao
55,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range.

61,US,"This is the winery's most expensive Chardonnay, and it's also easily their best.

67,New Zealand,"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Kim Crawford
68,Spain,"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD.

70,US,"Tasted side by side with the winery's 2007 Champoux Cabernet, this shares a stylistic astringency, but with a bit more forward cherry/berry fruit.

71,Italy,"Aromas of cassis, cola and a hint of lemon make for an attractive bouquet. The mouth is a bit tangy due to electric red fruit bolstered by powerful acids.

72,US,"Silky smooth, dry and classy, this Pinot shows great coastal personality in its tannins, crisp acidity and ripe flavors of cherries, cola, raspberries, pomegranates, orange zest and sweet rhubarb.

75,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods.

81,Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface.

Sweet, jammy aromas of crushed cherries laced with caramel pick up some creamy and cedary notes with airing, then cinnamon and red-earth and iron-mineral flavors spice up the palate.

188,US,"Nice Cab, a Rutherford-St. Helena blend that's tannic enough to warrant time in the cellar.

368,France,"Chatons, which means “kittens,” indicates this is a younger style of wine from Château du Cèdre. The dark, perfumed, mint and black berry flavored fruits give richness and precociousness.

372,US,"This is one of the most tannic Cabs Far Niente has produced in quite a while. It's really not drinkable now, despite very complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, tobacco and plums, along with plenty of smoky new oak. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while.

375,US,"Not many Merlots deserve time in the cellar, but this one does. Such are its mountain tannins that it's in lockdown mode, with a tough, astringent finish.

376,US,"It's another inky Rhône monster with aging potential from Epoch and their historic Paderewski Vineyard. This Syrah-led blend throws off inviting aromas of black cherry pie, violet, fennel and balsamic vinegar reduction.

A wine of little subtlety, but a good deal of character, it should be served with grilled meat, the more raw the better.",Vigna Ròca Neira,87,28.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Tenuta Rocca
552,Austria,"A complex blend that moves this wine into an international style. The wine is smooth, generous, almost opulent. It emphasizes rich red plum flavors, rounded out with jelly sweetness, the acidity coming with the a final burst of freshness.

554,Portugal,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style. It has much to do with the pure richness of the fruit (from 90-year-old vines) as the acidity which lifts and restrains the power.",Vinha Maria Teresa,94,150.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Crasto
555,Georgia,"Aged in buried clay vessels in accordance with ancient Georgian winemaking techniques, then transferred to new oak, there's a core of bright cherry fruit, coffee grinds and vanilla on the nose and palate of this unique Saperavi. It's a good wine, but charred wood, jagged tannins and hints of barnyard tend to obscure all the lovely fruit.",Satrapezo,84,40.0,Kakheti,,,Saperavi,Telavi

557,US,"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",,93,25.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Alta Maria

559,US,"Tasted along with Garretson's other reds, this one's considerably crisper and livelier in the mouth.

565,US,"Coffee, herb, cherry, cocoa and barrel-spice aromas draw you into the glass. The palate brings down a velvet hammer with dense, brooding dark cherry flavors backed by tightly wound tannins.

568,France,"Dry, spicy and rich, this is a pepper- and nutmeg-flavored wine. The ripe pear and melon flavors are concentrated and dense; the structure taut and minerally in character. It's a wine to age for 1–2 years.",Rosenberg,88,,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
569,Romania,"There are pleasant scents of vanilla, spice and poached pears on this Romanian Chardonnay, but the palate suffers from bracingly high acidity and faint apple flavors lacking depth and concentration.

574,Germany,"At just three years old, this bottle shows some developed petroleum notes that add interest to the often lackluster Silvaner grape.

576,US,"Honey, pineapple and pear on the nose are continued on the palate. The flavors are quite pretty but the overall structure of the wine tends toward watery; could use more acid and strength.

This '06, like its predecessors, is dry and medium-bodied, and shows a pleasant combination of cherry fruit brightened with fine acidity and wrapped into ripe, smooth tannins.

608,Spain,"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Opera Prima,83,6.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
609,US,"Dark and tannic, reflecting the vineyard's location in the cooler, foggier northwest, this Pinot Noir is dramatic in depth of flavor.

Dry essence of Riesling.",Iphöfer Kronsberg Spätlese Trocken,92,33.0,Franken,,,Riesling,Hans Wirsching

617,US,"This is the most balanced of the winery's many 2011 Zins. It's also half the price of the vineyard designates.

636,US,"Happily, each new vintage of Bésoleil is a bit larger than the previous year, so more people can taste what a joy this wine is. In 2008 it's 82% Grenache, 9% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre.

825,France,"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development.

839,US,"A lot of the fruit here comes from Lodi and that would be all well and good except the initially pleasing tropical nature of this wine, its guava and mango, full mouthfeel and texture, is wrecked by the high alcohol, which is hard to not notice, as is the wine's very sour finish.",Reserve,83,28.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Martin Lane Winery

848,US,"Almost as perfect a Stags Leap Cabernet as you can find, showing lush, opulent and immediately appealing flavors. Blackberries, plums, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet oak combine in a spicy swirl. The tannins are fiercely soft, an oxymoron that suggests the wine's complexity.

849,US,"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit.
